                                                                      Stock prediction  


1.Description: I will predict stock prices using different models LSTM , GRU ,Transformers and test it on different stocks AMZN , Tesla , AAPL , MSFT

2.Dependencies: I will use these libraries and tools to run the code (e.g., torch, yfinance, numpy, etc.).
Setup Instructions: 
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
import yfinance as yf

3.Data Source: I use yfinance to retrieve data 
def download_data(config, plot=False):
    ticker = config["yfinance"]["symbol"]
    data = yf.download(ticker, period=config["yfinance"]["period"], interval=config["yfinance"]["interval"])



Preprocessing: Describe any data cleaning or transformation steps, such as scaling or reshaping.
Model Architecture

4.Model Definition: Explain the architecture of the model, including layers like LSTM, Attention, etc.
Forward Pass: Describe how data moves through the model, from input to output.
Training Process
